So I wrote a lighter Logger Framework.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nLog2Server collect user defined log only, and split them into single files, each for one time periods of ten minutes long.\r\n\r\nYou can select the Local Log Storage as to Document or to Cache. By default Cache is used.\r\n\r\nYou can set the interval for sychronization with seconds. Initialized as one minute in Debug mode and 33 minutes in Product mode.\r\n\r\nYou can turn on the Debug Log for Log2Server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## iOS Side\r\n\r\nThe framework style of Log2Server integration is recommended, instead of the previous method using Objective-C source files directly.\r\n\r\nAdd `Log2Server` Framework into your iOS project; \r\n\r\nAdd framework to Target > Embedded Binaries; \r\n\r\nNote that if the Header File definition is not found, then add framework Headers path of to Build Settings Header Search Paths.\r\n\r\nIn `- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions` function of `AppDelegate` class, add the Log2Server Class register codes.\r\n\t\r\n\t[Log2ServerWorker registerServiceWithDeviceSignature:DEVICE_SIGNATURE andServerApi:SERVICE_API];\r\n\t[Log2ServerWorker setDebugMode:YES];\r\n    [Log2ServerWorker setUseDocumentStorage:NO];\r\n\t#ifdef DEBUG\r\n    [[Log2ServerWorker sharedInstance]setLogSyncInterval:60];\r\n\t#else\r\n    [[Log2ServerWorker sharedInstance]setLogSyncInterval:60*5];\r\n\t#endif\r\n    \r\n    SLog(@\"Log2ServerFrameworkDemo is Okay now if you have found these words on your server.\");\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Log2Server in every file, make use of Prefix Header, and add `#import \"Log2Server.h\"` into `#ifdef __OBJC__` and `#endif` block. This is recommended for easy using. You can copy the sample if your project is clean enough.\r\n\r\n\t#ifdef __OBJC__\r\n\t#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>\r\n\t#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\r\n\r\n\t#import \"Log2Server.h\"\r\n\r\n\t#endif\r\n\r\nThen you can use `SLog` just as `NSLog`, by which the log would be sent to the server.\r\n\r\n## Server Side\r\n\r\nA PHP Demo has been provided. Just try it.\r\n\r\nThe result is like:\r\n\r\n\troot@iZu1q2meizcZ:/var/log/Log2Server/Log2ServerDemo/Log2ServerFrameworkDemo# cat 2015061422_1 \r\n\t/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/B352F07E-403A-4DFA-81E0-750DBD4B855C/Library/Caches/Cache/\tLog2Server/2015061422_1\r\n\t[2015-06-14 22:21:55] -[AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:] [Line 26] \tLog2ServerFrameworkDemo is Okay now if you have found these words on your server.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
